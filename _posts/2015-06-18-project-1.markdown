description: Wikipedia was looking for a solution for site-wide alt-tagging of images. Art worked with one of their primary contributors to insure that the alt-tag methodologies represent best-practices, are able to be implemented across the entire site, and helped to develop a game in which contributors are incentivized to tag images.
