description: Art was tasked with developing an intranet for the employees of the Institute on Disability. The IODIntranet is used by employees every day to exchange messages, post news and events, share documents, and collaborate. This site was developed in Drupal, and utilizes several technologies in integrate with the University of New Hampshire to provide Secure Sign-On, Automatic Account Creation, AD Integration, and APACHE SOLR search. Unfortunately, if you're not a staff member of the IOD, you can't see how truly awesome it is!
